table:
<table>
<tr>
<th></th> //table header tag
</tr>
<tr>//table row tags
<td></td>//table data tags
</tr> 
</table>

css selectors:
element, id ,class selctors.
element with class selector:
<p class="intro">
p.intro{}

descendant selector:
div h1{} //selects all h1 inside divs

child selector:
div>h1{} //only selects h1 which is a direct descendant of this div

text decoration:
text-decoration: underline red solid 5px;
OR
text-decoration-line: underline;
  text-decoration-color: red;
  text-decoration-style: solid;
  text-decoration-thickness: 5px;

The most common text-decoration-line values used are: underline, overline, line-through and none. 
None is the default value to use no text decoration.

There are many styles available for the text-decoration-style  property;  solid,  double,  dotted,  dashed  
and  wavy. The text-decoration-style property requires the decoration line to be defined. If the decoration 
style is not specified, solid will be used.

If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height

HTML Element Left / Right Alignment

The two most common ways to left and right align elements are to use the float property and the position property.

The position property has several value options that impact how the element displays in the document flow. 
You'll explore how to use the position property later on. For now, let's focus on the float property.
The float property sets an element's position relative to the text content within a parent element. 
Text will wrap around the element.

LIBRARIES:
libraries and frameworks are called dependencies bcs the application depends on them
bootstrap is a famous library.
Your dependency usually depends on a lot of other libraries so it can be hard to download and configure
hundreds of dependencies. That is why a package manager such as npm or yarn is generally used to automatically
download and install dep. It downloads the entire dependency tree.

It can be hard to include all the dependencies in html so a bundling tool is used. Gulp and webpack are examples


Responsive design:
1-Flexible grids-use perccentages
2-Fluid Images-setting ma width to 100%
3-Media Queries

USING BOOTSTRAP:
the first element needed is the div with class container for any bootstrap grid. You can put a div with 
class row and then inside that a div with class col to use a grid. The bootstrap grid uses 12 breakpoints.
to use breakpoints use class col-2. If there were two classes one col-4 and other col-8. First one will take up 
1/3 and second 2/3 of the screen.

to maake it responsive use col-12 for mobile and col-lg-6 for desktop.

img-fluid class ensures the image has the same width as parent element and scales down but not up
table class is used with tables

Bootstrap has class infixes for several sizes. The default is extra small since bootstrap is for mobile first 
design.
extra small <576px(default)
sm >=576px
md >=768px
lg >=992px
xl >=1200px
xxl >=1400px

we have to insert these infixes into classes

Modifiers available in bootstrap are:primary,secondary,success,info,warning,danger,light,dark

<div class="col=lg-6"> //6 column css class

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert"> //to send alert message

<div class="text-center">//to center content inside a div

Bootstrap components:
Buttons,alerts, badges.
<span class="badge bg-primary">text</span>
<div class="card"> //inside col div
for image inside card use class=card-img-top
for text inside card add <div class="card-body>
on heading add class="card-title"
on p add class="card-text"

Switches
If you've used an app on your mobile device, you're probably familiar with the switch input type.

Bootstrap Doc Switches
Bootstrap includes CSS rules to style checkbox input elements as switches. 

To do this:
Add the input to a div element. 
On the div element, apply the form-check and form-switch CSS classes. 
On the input element, add the form-check-input CSS class.
<div class="form-check form-switch">
  <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox">
</div>

Other css libraries:
Foundation:
Foundation is a framework for building user interfaces similar to Bootstrap. It is used by many large companies 
such as Pixar, Polar and Sonos. One prominent feature of Foundation is that it can be used to style content for 
sending via email.

Pure.css:
Pure.css is another library for building user interfaces. While it doesn't have as many features as Bootstrap, 
it is designed to be minimal in file size. Smaller file sizes improve loading times for web pages as there is 
less data to transfer from the web server. If your next project is focused on minimal loading time, this library 
is worth considering.

Tailwind CSS:
Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that uses a utility-based approach for its CSS rules. This means that the 
framework provides many CSS classes with a single purpose. For example, the CSS class pt-6 sets the padding-top
CSS property to 6 pixels. This means that you can be precise in applying styling to your HTML without writing CSS.

UIKit:
UIKit is a lightweight CSS framework featuring a small set of responsive components. Its simple design allows 
developers to easily customize the style rules and visuals.

MVP.css:
MVP.css is a small CSS library that automatically styles HTML elements without needing to apply CSS classes to 
them. The library aims to allow a developer to quickly prototype a user interface without worrying about the 
final design, while still being visually appealing.


STATIC AND DYNAMIC CONTENT:
web server communicates with application server which generates dynamic content based on user inut or current 
dat etc.
This requires too much processing so web server holds dynamic content in cache and if request is same it serves
content otherwise asks app. server to generate new content.

SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIONS;
only one html page that gets sent from server to browser. The page updates as users interact with website.
Rewrites current page.
two approaches to serving code and res.
1-Bundling-When browser requests the application the server returns and loads all necessary html css and js.
If website is compplex can take a long time to download
2-Lazy loading or code splitting-Server returns only the minimum code.
