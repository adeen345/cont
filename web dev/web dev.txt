when two devices connect via a wired or wireless method its called a network. A nework switch connects 
multiple devices and allows them to communicate with each other. switches can connect to other switches too.
this results in a n interconnected network or the internet. Services on the internet are provided by servers.
Our devices are clients.
A server is a computer that runs applications services from websites to instant messaging. Stored in a data center
Many websites use these to allow you to access content quickly. A web server has many functions including website
storage, and administration, data storage, security and managing email. When you type a url in a browser web server
sends you back the websites content. THis is the request response cycle.

A web page is a document that displays images, text, videos and other content. A website is a collection of webpages 
that link together.

A web browser sends a request to a web server and recieves a response containing the content that needs to be 
displayed. You type an address in a browser which is called the uniform resource locator.
Url contains the protocol(HTTP), domain name, and the file path. The web server processes the request by taking the
key word and using it to find the req data which is stored on a database connected to the web server.

Developers can launch websites to the internet using web hosting.
Shared hosting: cheapest. you pay for location on a web server containing many hosting accounts. You share the 
processing power, memory and bandwisth. Best for small websites with small number of visitors.
Virtual private service: Virtual server with a dedicated cpu, memory and bandwidth resources. It runs on a hardware 
server with other vps instances. But resources are fixed per vps instance.
Dedicated hosting: Hardware server dedicated to you.
Cloud hosting: Website runs a cloud env. spanning across multiple phy and virt servers. you can use services without 
limitations and pay based on resource used.

Ip addresses identify a device connected to the internet. IPv4 and IPv6 are the most widely used internet protocols
When you send data across a network you send it as a series of ip packets. IP packets contain a header and data
(payload). Header contains destination and source ip addresses

The payload part of IP packets supports multiple protocols to make sure that information arrives as expected. 
Two of these are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 
TCP is used for data that must arrive correctly and in order. This is because TCP can deal with data packets 
arriving out of order, becoming damaged or corrupted, or dropped or lost albeit at the cost of a small delay.
UDP solves the corrupt packet issue. It is used for sending data than can handle some loss such as calls or live
video. Both contain payloads that contain further protocols inside them.

HTTPS is the seccure version of http.It enables your browser to communicate with the web server hosting the 
website. It is a req res based protocol.
HTTP request consists of a method(GET POST etc) path version and headers.
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
Accept-Language: en

Some http methods will contain a body of request.
HTTP version 1.1 and 2 are mostly used.
HTTP response follows the same format. They might contain a body. but also contain status codes.
Status codes are grouped into 5 stoges by the first number:
Informational:100-199 //provisional res sent by server. 100 continue is most common and indiccates that web client
should continue request or ignore response if req finished
Successful:200-299 //200 ok
Redirection:300-399//indicate the resource has been moved to a diffrent path. 301 moved permanently. 302 found.
Clien Error:400-499 //400 when client submitted bad data. 401 to indicate login req. 403 means request valid
but web server refusing to process means not authorized. 404 to indicate resource not found.
Server error:500-599 //500 internal server error means server failed to process the request.

HTTPS is used for secure comm bw two computers so that nobody else can see the  info being sent and recieved.
It uses encryption. The difference is that before req and res are sent the content is turned into secret code.

Every HTTP request begins with the request line.
This consists of the HTTP method, the requested resource and the HTTP protocol version.
GET /home.html HTTP/1.1 
In this example, GET is the HTTP method, /home.html is the resource requested and HTTP 1.1 is the protocol used.

HTTP methods:
GET-The client requests a resource on the web server.
POST-The client submits data to a resource on the web server.
PUT-The client replaces a resource on the web server.
DELETE-The client deletes a resource on the web server.

After the request line, the HTTP headers are followed by a line break.

There are various possibilities when including an HTTP header in the HTTP request. A header is a 
case-insensitive name followed by a: and then followed by a value.
The Host header specifies the host of the server and indicates where the resource is requested from.

The User-Agent header informs the web server of the application that is making the request. 
It often includes the operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux), version and application vendor.
The Accept header informs the web server what type of content the client will accept as the response.
The Accept-Language header indicates the language and optionally the locale that the client prefers.
The Content-type header indicates the type of content being transmitted in the request body.

HTTP requests can optionally include a request body. A request body is often included when using the HTTP 
POST and PUT methods to transmit data.

POST /users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

{
 "key1":"value1",
 "key2":"value2",
 "array1":["value3","value4"]
}

When the web server is finished processing the HTTP request, it will send back an HTTP response.
The first line of the response is the status line. This line shows the client if the request was successful or 
if an error occurred.
HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
The line begins with the HTTP protocol version, followed by the status code and a reason phrase. The reason phrase
is a textual representation of the status code.
The first digit of an HTTP status code indicates the category of the response: Information, Successful, 
Redirection, Client Error or Server Error.

Following the status line, there are optional HTTP response headers followed by a line break.
Similar to the request headers, there are many possible HTTP headers that can be included in the HTTP response.

Common response headers are:
Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2022 15:00:00 GMT+2
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Linux)
Content-Length: 84
Content-Type: text/html

The Date header specifies the date and time the HTTP response was generated.
The Server header describes the web server software used to generate the response.
The Content-Length header describes the length of the response.
The Content-Type header describes the media type of the resource returned (e.g. HTML document, image, video).

Following the HTTP response headers is the HTTP response body. This is the main content of the HTTP response.
This can contain images, video, HTML documents and other media types.


Hypertext Transfer Protocols (HTTP) are used on top of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to transfer webpages 
and other content from websites.
When your computer connects to a network, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP as it is commonly known, 
is used to assign your computer an IP address.
Your computer communicates over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) using the protocol with a type of server called a 
DHCP server. 

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):The server keeps track of computers on the network and their IP 
addresses. It will assign your computer an IP address and respond over the protocol to let it know which IP 
address to use. Once your computer has an IP address, it can communicate with other computers on the network.

Domain Name System Protocol (DNS):
Your computer needs a way to know with which IP address to communicate when you visit a website in your web 
browser, for example, meta.com. The Domain Name System Protocol, commonly known as DNS, provides this function. 
Your computer then checks with the DNS server associated with the domain name and then returns the correct IP 
address.

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP):Do you check your emails on your mobile or tablet device? Or maybe you use 
an email application on your computer? Your device needs a way to download emails and manage your mailbox on the 
server storing your emails. This is the purpose of the Internet Message Access Protocol or IMAP.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): Now that your emails are on your device, you need a way to send emails. 
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or SMTP, is used. It allows email clients to submit emails for sending via 
an SMTP server. You can also use it to receive emails from an email client, but IMAP is more commonly used.

Post Office Protocol (POP):The Post Office Protocol (POP) is an older protocol used to download emails to an 
email client. The main difference in using POP instead of IMAP is that POP will delete the emails on the server 
once they have been downloaded to your local device. Although it is no longer commonly used in email clients, 
developers often use it to implement email automation as it is a more straightforward protocol than IMAP.

File Transfer Protocol (FTP): When running your websites and web applications on the Internet, you'll need a 
way to transfer the files from your local computer to the server they'll run on. The standard protocol used 
for this is the File Transfer Protocol or FTP. FTP allows you to list, send, receive and delete files on a server. 
Your server must run an FTP Server and you will need an FTP Client on your local machine. You'll learn more about 
these in a later course.

Secure Shell Protocol (SSH): When you start working with servers, you'll also need a way to log in and interact 
with the computer remotely. The most common method of doing this is using the Secure Shell Protocol, commonly 
referred to as SSH. Using an SSH client allows you to connect to an SSH server running on a server to perform 
commands on the remote computer. All data sent over SSH is encrypted. This means that third parties cannot 
understand the data transmitted. Only the sending and receiving computers can understand the data.

SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP):The data is transmitted insecurely when using the File Transfer Protocol. 
This means that third parties may understand the data that you are sending. This is not right if you transmit 
company files such as software and databases. To solve this, the SSH File Transfer Protocol, alternatively called 
the Secure File Transfer Protocol, can be used to transfer files over the SSH protocol. This ensures that the 
data is transmitted securely. Most FTP clients also support the SFTP protocol.

Difference between websites and webapps is the level of interacctivity. Apps are a lot more interactive.

LIBRARIES AND FRAMWORKS:
libraries are reusable pieces of code. Purpose built to provide a specific functionality. for eg validating email

Frameworks provide structure for developers to build with. Frameworks use many libraries.
