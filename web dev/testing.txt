JEST:
testing framework

function ConcatStrings(a,b){
	return a+b
}

expect(ConcatStrings('abc','def').toBe('abcdef'))

You need to write ccode so that it passes a test. 
Refactoring is the process of rewriting better code without changing functionality

Red green refactor cycle is when some tests fail(Red) and you refactor your code to pass those tess. THis 
is part of test driven  development

E2E testing: Interact with a website like an end user.
WebdriverJS, Protractor,Cypress

Integration testing: how parts of system interact with each other. React-testing-library, and enzyme

Unit testing; testing the smallest units of source code in isolation

Mocking: Separating code from related dependencies during testing.
Snapshot testing is used by dev to verify that there are no regressions in the dom after some changes to code
base are made.


npm install --save-dev jest

in the "test" script write "jest"
"test":"jest"

make a file
name.test.js //name should be same as the file to be tested. and module.exports should be done in file 

const {default:TestRunner}=require("jest-runner")
cont file=require('./file')

test('returns the number plus 5',()=>{
	expect(addFive(2).toBe(7))
})
test('returns true if statusOfKeys exists'()=>{
	expect(statusOfKeys).toBeDefined()
}

TDD:
streamlined process of writing code that will satisfy some requirements.
Write a failing test->writing code to pass the test
